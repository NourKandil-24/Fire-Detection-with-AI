# Fire-Detection-with-AI
By training classifiers such as SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, and extracting features like HSV values, brightness, edges, and color histograms, we can develop an AI model that is capable of accurately detecting fire or the absence of fire in images, using these features to classify the images based on their visual characteristics.
